Basic display

tmux lists all currently running tmux sessions line by line, according to the
following format:
  - an indicator for whether the session is currently detached [x] or attached
    [o]
  - the name of the session (in bold white)
  - the currently running command, if any (in cyan brackets)
  - the time the session's current command has been running (in green parentheses)
  - the time the session's current command has been idling (i.e., not produced
    output) (in yellow parentheses)
  - if no command is running, the total execution time for the last command
    (in magenta parentheses)
Below all of the current sessions and a divider line, the currently
highlighted session's last three nonempty lines of input are shown

Basic commands
  - up and down arrow keys scroll through highlighted items
  - "o" and right arrow and enter key attaches a completely detached session to a
    terminal (current only xfce4-terminal is supported)
  - "x" and left arrow completely detaches the highlighted session, and closes a
    detached session for which no command is currently running
  - Control + "x" closes the highlighted session, regardless of whether it is attached or
    running
  - "w" writes the complete buffer of the highlighted session to a log file
  - "q" exits tman
  - "i" enters insert command mode to send text directly to tmux sessions
    (escape key to exit, left arrow to backspace)
  - "r" enters rename mode to rename a session (escape key to exit, left arrow
    to backspace)
